I'm a student at Yale College ('22) studying computer science and psychology. My academic interests include technical and social challenges surrounding artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
I also enjoy improv comedy, snowboarding, and learning new languages!

I've participated in SWE internship programs at companies of all sizes, including [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) (2020, Cloud and AI Security), [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) (2019, Red Team), and [Lexody](https://www.lexody.com/welcome/about) (2017). Currently, I'm interning at [PicCollage](https://picc.co/products) in Taiwan! I'm also a student researcher in the [Intelligent Computing Lab](https://intelligentcomputinglab.yale.edu/) and [CLAY Lab](http://clay.yale.edu/).
